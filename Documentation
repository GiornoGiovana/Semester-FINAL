	Our project will use sliders as a form of input. 
	Users will move the sliders to change the value of different variables in order to choose how much time they spend 
	on each activity per week. The program takes the numbers from the sliders and performs calculations specified by the
	‘Basic rules’ table in the game project overview. The output and other information are displayed on screen. 
	
>Who Did What?

•	Jack did the documentation
•	Chris made sliders for input. He was able to add numbers to understand input for the code.
•	Young set up and organized a github so we can effectively share our files. He created powerpoint.
•	Jacob organized the design deliverable and set up group communications so we can communicate. Helped with presentation.
	Helped with adding questions to code. 

>How does our system work?
	Our system uses a series of sliders to select number of hours per activity. This information will be selected every
	week for 15 weeks. After the user inputs the numbers for each category, the user will push "next". Once the user pushes this
	button, a screen will appear with the level of happiness, grades, and wealth.

	Instead of using a picture where you can click on it and a pop up box is dispayed to input a number, we are going to 
	use sliders to select the number of hours per activity. We 



>What enhancements do we plan to make?
	We will also have the ablitiy to do quick game where the input for one week is the same for all 
	15 weeks.
