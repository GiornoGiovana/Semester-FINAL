	Our project will use sliders as a form of input. 
	Users will move the sliders to change the value of different variables in order to choose how much time they spend 
	on each activity per week. The program takes the numbers from the sliders and performs calculations specified by the
	‘Basic rules’ table in the game project overview. The output and other information are displayed on screen.
